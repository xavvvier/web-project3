        <h2>Are you interested in volunteering? Contact us!</h2>
        <p>
           As we do each year, Celebrate Multiculturalism is looking for volunteers to help make this year's festival
           a success. We need a whole team of volunteers and all people are welcome. No one is expected to volunteer
           at the festival all four days and positions are available for each day. If you are interested, please
           browse our list of available volunteer positions and contact Joey Seth at
           <a href="mailto:j.seth@celebratemulticulturalism.org">j.seth@celebratemulticulturalism.org</a>
           with a copy of your resume. Bonus: Free admission to the festival (a.k.a. Free Food!!)
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Available Volunteer Positions:</h4>
            <b>Ticket Booth Operator</b> - we need trusty, customer service friendly individuals who are handy with a 
            calculator... (I do know you exist!!) Sometimes it can get pretty lonely in the booth, so we always pair
            you up with another volunteer - make sure to bring lots of water!!
            <br><br>

            <b>First Aiders</b> - we are looking for certified volunteers who would like to get some on the spot training
            for minor cuts and bruises, heat exhaustion and the occasional chopped off finger. Standard first aid 
            is a minimum.
            <br><br>

            <b>Security</b> - this isn't necessarily a security position, we just need individuals to monitor the crowds at
            the park. Keeping an eye out for pick pockets and vanals and any other number of mischievous activities would
            your duties. Bonus: you get to carry around a walkie talkie.
            <br><br>

            <b>Ground Crew</b> - this job requires individuals who are capable of doing heavy lifting: setting up the stage and 
            the tents requires a lot of strength and energy. Still interested?
            <br><br>

            <b>Beverage Vendors</b> - while there is a lot of food at the festival, water and other beverages are usually in short
            demand. Again, we need customer service and juice knowledgeable individuals to run these booths.
